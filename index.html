Hi, I'm Niraj.

I'm a graduate student at USF studying information systems and entrepreneurship.

I enjoy engineering, product, and finance. This past summer, I was a Technical PM at Slack in the Bay, where I managed vision and delivery of some exciting data tools.

When I'm not working, I like to jump off cliffs, camp, drive, dance, and listen to classic rock. I also make horrible puns from time to time.

Facts
I'm a huge Porsche fanboy, aircooled or not. The 918 Spyder is my favorite, closely followed by the Carrera GT. I also have a 1987 911 Turbo poster. It's the only poster I've ever had up in my room.
I love classic rock music. I enjoy listening to Queen, The Beatles, and Led Zeppelin. I also enjoy old Bollywood music -- nothing hits quite as hard as Kishore Kumar on Mulholland Drive at 3 am.
I've spent most of my college life in California, so I decided to visit every location Apple named a MacOS version after. I completed this in Summer 2023, covering Sonoma the week before it was released.
The time I wasn't in class or at a MacOS destination was probably spent at a Trader Joe's. I'm a firm believer in their coconut water and frozen tikka masala.
My favorite TV shows include The Wire, The Sopranos, and the Breaking Bad universe. Interstellar is my favorite film. My comfort film is probably Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. I've watched it more times than I went to class (which I understand isn't saying a lot, but it's honest work).
I spent 42 minutes debating if I should name this section "Fun facts." I'll let you decide if this was fun. Vote here.
